Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment helped me gain familiarity in both emacs and gdb.
I got better at reading code that was written by other people, as well
as understanding the invariants of an abstract object. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I enjoyed it! Debugging didn't take as long as I would have thought
for part 3, but part 1 took a while.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

ft.c: (in function FT_traversePath)
ft.c:90:45: Variable ulChildID used before definition
      An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
      path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
node.c: (in function Node_new)
node.c:187:50: Variable ulIndex used before definition
node.c: (in function Node_free)
node.c:219:37: Variable ulIndex used before definition
path.h:94:13: Function exported but not used outside path: Path_getComponent
      A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
      use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
      path.c:316:1: Definition of Path_getComponent

All of these splint warnings result directly from repurposing the DT 
code that was provided to us, as they also appear when splinting the 
files from part 2. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

node.c:
      node.c: line 305: low priority: 
      A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
      this file contains 16 functions
   
      node.c: line 47: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
   
      node.c: line 93: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

ft.c: 
      ft.c: line 374: low priority: 
      A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
      this loop consists of 39 lines; consider refactoring
   
      ft.c: line 650: low priority: 
      A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
      this file contains 17 functions
   
      ft.c: line 314: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?
   
      ft.c: line 477: medium priority:
      Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?
   
      ft.c: line 649: low priority: 
      A source code file should contain fewer than 500 lines;
      this file contains 650 lines

We do not validate that pvContents or pvNewContents is not NULL because
we allow files to have NULL contents and one of our invariants is that
directories have NULL contents. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1            BDT_insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2            BDT_freeSubtree
         --> BDT_rm
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3            BDT_addChild
         --> BDT_insert --> newNode --> addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4            BDT_strlenAccumulate
         --> to_String --> DynArray_map
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5            BDT_findNode
         --> BDT_contains
===============================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

Consistency of parameter orders in nodeDT.h:
We can improve the consistency of the parameter ordering in nodeDT.
For example, Node_new orders its parameters by path, parent, result.
Whereas Node_hasChild orders its parametesr by parent, path, child.
The inverted order of parent and path can make calling these function
unnecessarily confusing.

Improve naming of ENUMS:
We think that the return status ENUMS can be interpreted vaguely.
For example, it is not immediately recognizable what the difference
is between a BAD, CONFLICTING, or NO_SUCH path. It could be helpful to 
make these enum names more specific (which is also something we could
have improved on in part 3).
